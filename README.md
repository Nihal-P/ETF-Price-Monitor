Full Stack Developer Interview
This is an interview for the full stack data developer role at BMO Capital Markets' Data Cognition Team.



Requirements


Design a single page web application (actually a single page!) that allows traders to view historical prices for a given ETF and its top holdings.

The frontend should be written in a front end framework such as Angular, React, Vue or any other framework that you feel comfortable.

The backend can be anything you want. We primarily use Python but you're free to pick whatever you like.



Partial solutions are acceptable. It is not necessary to submit a complete solution that implements every requirement.




Quick introduction to ETFs


ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) are traded securities that hold a basket of securities; the securities could be stocks, bonds, or even other ETFs!

In general, the price of the ETF at any time can be computed by doing a weighted sum of the price of each individual constituent and we'll be assuming

that the weights are not changing over time in this challenge.





Data provided


We've provided all the data you need to complete the challenge. You don't need to contact any public external API.





We've provided:


`ETF1.csv` and `ETF2.csv` containing the constituents and their weights in each ETF
`prices.csv` which contains the historical price data for all the constituents. Note that this file contains prices for all constituents




Functionality


Upload a `.csv` file containing weights of a given ETF, `ETF1.csv` or `ETF2.csv`
An interactive table similar to the uploaded `ETF[1-2].csv` file on the webpage that displays three columns
The constituent name, i.e., A
The weight, i.e., 0.02
The most recent close price of the constituent, i.e., $20.05 for A
A zoomable time series plot of the reconstructed price of the ETF. The price of the ETF is calculated as the weighted sum of the individual prices
A bar chart displaying the top 5 biggest holdings in the ETF as of the latest market close. You can compute the holding size of each constituent by multiplying the weight and the price




Challenge Scope


High level description of design and technologies used
Document all assumptions made
Complete solutions aren't required, but what you do submit needs to run




What are we looking for? What does this prove?


Assumptions you make given limited requirements
Technology and design choices
Identify areas of your strengths
This is not a pass or fail test, this will serve as a common ground that we can deep dive together into specific issues


Submission Guidelines:


Follow a clear project structure and include a README file with summary.
Submit within 4 days and prepare for an in-person review.
